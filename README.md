# Autonomous USV (___IN PROGRESS___)
This project is intended to serve as a base for future more complicated robotics projects. I started this orginally to learn ROS, Linux, and C++ on a deeper level. As it has progressed it's truly turned into a passion for marine robotics due to the interesting and diverse challenges that come with the environment. Open source marine robotics projects seem to be few and far between. I hope someone who looks to do something similar can fine this repository useful. I'd like to thank the following people for being valuable resources through this journey:
- [DroneBot Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/c/Dronebotworkshop1)
- [GreatScott!](https://www.youtube.com/c/greatscottlab)
- [How To Mechatronics](https://www.youtube.com/c/HowToMechatronics)
- [James Bruton](https://www.youtube.com/c/jamesbruton)
- [Peter Stripol](https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterSripol)
- [rctestflight](https://www.youtube.com/c/rctestflight)
- [electrosync](https://www.youtube.com/c/electrosync)

These amazing engineers truly helped shape my ideas and dreams into reality. The things they have built are very awe inspiring and will continue help others learn the interesting niche that is robotics.
